You are the kitty. Get the mouse.

This is a very basic game that I made (with help) so that I could learn C#/XNA/MonoGame.
It is not very fun to play but I really enjoyed creating it.

Please credit me if you re-use my noob code but otherwise feel free to dig through and mess with it.

=^..^= thank you for playing!
